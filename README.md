# Order Book Trading Framework

Plan:
- load obpy
- order book visualizer
- time factory
- usage from jupyter
- extend tests
- build and deploy in docker
- skip updates outside order book / reload when shifted 25%
- obpy restarts when connection lost

## Development

```console
brew install poetry
poetry install
poetry shell
```
